## Why grey market® software keys are bad™

This is mostly just for windows as that's where it comes up the most in my life.

 - Usually the keys are obtained via scummy methods (Ie; Chargeback, Stolen payment methods)
 - The most legit keys are generally bulk-bought for use within an organization, but it's against the TOU to resell them - [The EU is an exception to this rule however](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcforme/comments/fb432g/mod_reminder_rules_regarding_grey_market_software/fj3es7l/), so people in that region might be able to find a legit dealer, which is the hard part :)
 - Unless you *know* the key is coming from a legit organization in the EU selling their excess OEM keys, it's morally bad (even as compared to piracy) to buy a grey market software key as it's putting money in the hands of scammers, instead of the group that deserves it (which is unequivocally Microsoft in the case of Windows/Office licenses, regardless of how bad they are as a company).
 - Many of these sites have sockpuppets & bots advertising on places like reddit, making it _very_ difficult to find any actual information about them.
