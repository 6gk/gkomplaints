### Phones

 - Frequent "Account terms updated" notifications
 - Ugly UI
   * Offensively bad default icon theme
   * Harsh blue hurts my soul
   * Just generally ugly tbh
 - Samsung Store
   * Overall bad, terrible to use and navigate
   * Some software is hidden from play store, and instead moved to the samsung store.
 - Lies, broken promise(s)
   * The *Samsung A8 (2018)* - a phone I used for a few years - released with Android 7, which was roughly 3 months out-of-date, they immediately pushed an update to Android 8, which used up one of their promised 2 major updates, with the second one being used for Android 9, which released **less than a year** after the phone.

 - Annoying with non-system applications
   * [Monke] Tik-Tok is automatically installed on some phones
   * [Monke] You cannot uninstall facebook on some phones
   * [Monke] "dolby atmos" (i don't understand what they mean but they dislike it so üëç)
 - [Monke] Unlocking the bootloader / installing magisk is "painful", and you need a computer to boot into recovery
 
### Other

 - The *Samsung Galaxy Book 2* has quite literally the worst keyboard I've ever touched due to the incorrect key spacing/size, which makes it damn near impossible to comfortably type, especially if you're used to not looking at the keyboard.
