## Why samsung is bad™

### Phones

 - Frequent "Account terms updated" notifications
 - Ugly UI
   * Offensively bad default icon theme
   * Harsh blue hurts my soul
   * Just generally ugly tbh
 - Samsung Store
   * Overall bad, terrible to use and navigate
   * Some software is hidden from play store, and instead moved to the samsung store.
 - Lies, broken promise(s)
   * The *Samsung A8 (2018)* - a phone I used for a few years - released with Android 7, which was roughly 3 months out-of-date, they immediately pushed an update to Android 8, which used up one of their promised 2 major updates, with the second one being used for Android 9, which released **less than a year** after the phone.
 - [Monke] Annoying with non-system applications
   * [Monke] Tik-Tok is automatically installed on some phones
   * [Monke] You cannot uninstall Facebook on some phones
 - [Monke] Rooting is cringe
   * [Monke] The OEM Unlocking switch has no useful purpose other than downgrading - To unlock the bootloader you have to power off the phone, hold both volume keys, then plug it into a computer.
   * [Monke] Due to a lack of A/B Partitions, you need to use a computer to update with Magisk
   * [Monke] No official tools for flashing, and odin, a third-party program, is pain™
   * [Monke] No default backup of EFS, if you don't manually back it up the IMEI will reset to 000000000000000, rendering the phone useless for phone stuff
 - [Monke] Stock roms aren't easily available
 
### Other

 - The *Samsung Galaxy Book 2* has quite literally the worst keyboard I've ever touched due to the incorrect key spacing/size, which makes it damn near impossible to comfortably type, especially if you're used to not looking at the keyboard.
