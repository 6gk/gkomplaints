## Why samsung is bad™

### Phones

 - Frequent useless & annoying notifications
   * "Account terms updated" every time their intern finds something questionable on reddit that might get them sued for $5 if the redditor hires million dollar lawyers.
   * Samsung Cloud's "Auto backing up your data..." that hangs well after the fact even though I didn't opt in, and didn't see a way to easily disable it.
 - Ugly UI
   * Offensively bad default icon theme
   * Harsh blue hurts my soul
   * Just generally ugly tbh
 - Samsung Store
   * Overall bad, terrible to use and navigate
   * Some software is hidden from play store, and instead moved to the samsung store.
 - Lies, broken promise(s)
   * The *Samsung A8 (2018)* - a phone I used for a few years - released with Android 7, which was roughly 3 months out-of-date, they immediately pushed an update to Android 8, which used up one of their promised 2 major updates, with the second one being used for Android 9, which released **less than a year** after the phone.
 - [Monke] Annoying with non-system applications
   * [Monke] Tik-Tok is automatically installed on some phones
   * [Monke] You cannot uninstall Facebook (and other potentially unwanted apps) on some phones
 - [Monke] Rooting is cringe
   * [Monke] The OEM Unlocking switch has no useful purpose other than downgrading - To unlock the bootloader you have to power off the phone, hold both volume keys, then plug it into a computer. Contrary to older models and other phones, this will wipe the phone
   * [Monke] Due to a lack of A/B Partitions, you need to use a computer to update with Magisk
   * [Monke] No official tools for flashing, apart from leaked versions of Odin3 floating around. Heimdall, an alternative to Odin3, is pain™
   * [Monke] No default backup of EFS, if you don't manually back it up the IMEI will reset to 000000000000000, rendering the phone useless for phone stuff
 - [Monke] Stock roms can only be obtained via the use of third-party websites and tools
 - [Glint] Older "A" series Samsung phones, when updated to Android 12 become poorly optimised and kill applications frequently.
 - [Glint] During the setup process, preselected applications and games for installation which are confusing to deselect (Tik-Tok and Temple Run I find are the most common)

### TVs
 - [Glint] Some Samsung "smart" TVs - when connected to the LAN - spam ARP requests to the router every 2 seconds.
 - [Glint] The OS is incredibly slow and littered with advertising.
 
### Other

 - The *Samsung Galaxy Book 2* has quite literally the worst keyboard I've ever touched due to the incorrect key spacing/size, which makes it damn near impossible to comfortably type, especially if you're used to not looking at the keyboard.
